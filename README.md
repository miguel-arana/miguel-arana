- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel Arana. Currently a student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am majoring in Information Systems, focusing my studies on Networking and Cybersecurity.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Networking and Cloud Technologies in general. For the longest time, I avoided programming because I thought I wouldn't like it. But when I was exposed to different coding projects recently, I fell in love with the challenges that coding projects have presented me. I think I'm pretty good at problem solving.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure and building CI/CD pipelines for ARM template deployments
