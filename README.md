- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel Arana. Currently a student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am majoring in Information Systems, focusing my studies on Networking and Cybersecurity.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Networking and Cloud Technologies in general. But...
- 🧐 For the longest time, I avoided programming because I thought I wouldn't like it. But when I was exposed to different coding projects recently, I fell in love with the challenges that was presented me. I think I'm pretty good at problem solving. I'm relentless, so if there's a problem to fix, I do my best to use the resources around me to get the job done. I will force myself to pickup new tools to solve problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure and building CI/CD pipelines for ARM template deployments
